/* ============ ADD HERE YOUR CUSTOM SCSS or  plain CSS CODE. ============ 

HOW DOES IT WORK?

    Edit this file, save, 
    view page as admin:
    The style will be AUTOMATICALLY recompiled and 
    your new CSS bundle will be reloaded via ajax to show 
    the new styling edits.

NOTICE for beginners: 

    CODE HERE YOUR MASTERPIECE, but before that, if you haven't yet,
    please take your time to understand and study how Bootstrap works.
    It can save you a lot of time,
    eg. to standardize project colors, or fully customize typography.
    First of all, have a ride in the WordPress Customizer.
    Then learn to use Bootstrap 5 Classes and utilities.
    If you come from the CSS world, take some time to study the basic of SASS. It's very powerful.
    With great powers...you are warned 


IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING REFERENCING ELEMENTS IN THE THEME FOLDER
    Please access those prepending ../ in the path, as the rendered CSS
    that is executed from the browser is in the /css-output/ theme subfolder
