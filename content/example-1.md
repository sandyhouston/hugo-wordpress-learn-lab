<h1 class="margin-top-zero">Integrating ideas with reporting words</h1>
<p class="lead">Whether you are paraphrasing or quoting, integrating the ideas of others with your own argument is an important part of clear, cohesive communication. It’s easy to become repetitive, using ‘this author said’ and ‘that author said’ over and over. Reporting words tell your audience more about a person’s position on a topic, not just that they ‘said’ something.</p>
<h2>Reporting words</h2>
<p>Reporting words are verbs that help us describe an author’s position on a topic. The reporting word you choose can help your audience understand the viewpoint of the original author, or it might express your own opinion about that author’s work. There are many of these words in English, and they all have different meanings. Some are more forceful, while others express a more modest position on a topic.</p>
<blockquote>
	<div class="content">
		<h3 class="h4">Examples</h3>
		<p>Author (2023) <strong>questions</strong> the idea that income from Australian mining exports will likely increase in the next two years.</p>
		<p>Author (2023) <strong>dismisses</strong> the idea that income from Australian mining exports will likely increase in the next two years.</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first example, the word <strong>questions</strong> shows the audience that Author (2023) doesn’t necessarily believe mining export income will increase. In contrast, the use of the word <strong>dismisses</strong> in the second example shows a much stronger position; Author is no longer just questioning the idea, but has completely rejected it.</p>
<p>Choosing the right reporting word is tricky because of the way words have small differences in meaning as well as in the positive, negative, or neutral feelings connected to a word, also known as connotation. A dictionary can help you understand if you’ve chosen the right reporting word for the idea you want to express.</p>
